It's time again for the more or less annual reboot of my blaging.

Not much to say other than that I'm currently moving email, web
etc. etc to different machines (e.g this page is now hosted on github
instead of my own server).

patrikgreco.se and sikevux.se are essentialy going to point at the
same page, just need to fix a few things iirc.

Oh, and by the way, I ordered an Raspberry Pi, so now I'm just as cool
as the other geeks.
