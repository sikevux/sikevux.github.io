I can't help but to feel like a deserter, but I have to do this.

For several years now I have been active in the Swedish Young Pirates (Ung Pirat), and my years in the organization have been educational, to say the least, and I've met new friends, but my dedication for the organization have caused personal problems for me, and lately it haven't even been doing what I am supposed to do all that great. Truthfully I have done a terrible job, yet still managed to mess up my personal life.

Therefore, I hereby leave my post on the Board of the Swedish Young Pirates, as well as any other role I have had in the organization, with the exception of Ung Pirat Lund, where I will step down after the annual meeting in January.
