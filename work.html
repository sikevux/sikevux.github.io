				<p>I do all kinds of things related to computer science. Notably I've heavily customized Fedora into a distribution tailored for a customer, lots of fun with .ks, sed, etc. I was previously active in a LAN-party organization, where I was part of the three man team that built a booking system in PHP. I'm also the creator of some applications for the Android Linux distribution, all of them written in Java.</p>
				<p>I'm also pretty good at system management, with most experience in RHEL based and Debian based distribution. I have been using Gentoo for almost three years, so I'm fairly proficient in that area too. I can also work with Sun Solaris, but have never touched Oracle Solaris.</p>
				<p>My current employer is <a href="http://videocent.com">Videocent</a> and by proxy <a href="http://sensefarm.com">Sensefarm</a></p>
